# confusion 36d 


7 years of hobby programming - in a stack of libraries.


This is my attempt to make an open source CNC controller using a bunch of graphics code I wrote for fun. 


Contains a combination of older tools I built: 


This tool for 3D spatial motion control 
https://github.com/keithlegg/micro_cnc_controller


This tool for a simple OpenGL GUI and 3D math libraries
The libraries are a mess and need a cleanup/rewrite.
